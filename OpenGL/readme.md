## Involved Problems
- Workaround for packaging files with command line application. Command line application wraps recources (shaders) by 'copy files' build configuration. (uncheck 'copy only when insalling' option to enable copying during debug phase).
- When you organize your desktop OpenGL application through command line approach, you can't package any of your resource file into a non bundle. So be careful of the shader files path,before start building,specify the right shader path. 
- Fail to add shader source string loading support using GLSL macro.
