###19.1.1 颜色空间的映射
At this point, we already have enough information to roughly map out the color cone.
当前的这个时点，我们已经有足够信息来大略映射出颜色锥体（color cone ？颜色锥体的形状）。

Scales of vectors in the cone correspond to brightness changes in our perceived color sensation, and thus are not very interesting. (Though, when we dim an orange light, we actually perceive the color brown.) Thus it is convenient to normalize our color diagram by scale, obtaining a 2D drawing (see Figure 19.2). In this diagram, we have started with the slice of the cone from Figure 19.7. All displayed colors have then been scaled so that one of R, G, or B is at full strength. We cannot display colors outside of the drawn triangle using positive combinations of the R G and B display elements of a monitor. We say that such colors lay outside of the gamut of our display.
颜色锥体（color cone）中矢量（vectors）的缩放对应于我们可察觉到的颜色感知中的亮度变化，那么从而这种行为就不是很有趣。（虽然，在我们讲一束桔（橙）色的光模糊后，我们实际会感知到棕色。）因而通过缩放（scale？）来标准化颜色图是方便的，从而获得一个2D图示（2D drawing）（如图19.2）。在本图示中，我们从来自图19.7中的颜色锥体的切片开始。所有被展示的颜色被缩放一遍R，G或者B中的一个在完全的强度上。以显示器R、G和B显示元件（phosphor）的正线性组合，我们不能够展示出图示中被绘制的三角形范围之外的色彩。我们讲这样的色彩位于显示器展示范围之外。

Colors along the boundary of the cone are vivid and are perceived as “saturated”. Starting from the L axis, and moving along the curved portion, we move along the rainbow colors from red to green to violet. These colors can only be achieved by pure beams. Additionally the color cone’s boundary has a planar wedge (a line segment in the 2D ﬁgure). The colors on this wedge are the pinks and purples. They do not appear in the rainbow and can only be achieved by appropriately combining beams of red and violet. As as we circle around the boundary, we move through the different “hues” of color.
